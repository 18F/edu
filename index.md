18F Edu is the self-guided training component of the 18F Learn initiative. We
aim to supplement the [18F Guides](https://pages.18f.gov/guides/) with
hands-on exercises that can solidify your grasp of those materials. The
combined body of 18F Guides and 18F Edu training modules aim to support the
concepts promoted in the [U.S. Digital Services
Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/).
